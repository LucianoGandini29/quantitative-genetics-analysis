# quantitative-genetics-analysis
Generalized Mixed models and Bayesian inference in R applied to quantitative genetics and survival data analysis.

This repository contains examples of statistical and quantitative genetics analyses performed in **R**, based on my research in applied quantitative genetics and evolutionary biology.  
It includes code for **GLMMs**, **Bayesian models (STAN)**, and **survival analysis**.

## Repository structure

## Main contents

### Bayesian modeling (brms)
Examples of Bayesian inference for quantitative genetics using the **brms** package, including model specification, posterior summaries, pp-checks, and visualization.

### Survival analysis (brms)
Analysis of censored time-to-event data using bayesian parametric survival models, relevant to experimental data on development time, lifespan, or treatment response.

### Visualization
All analyses include reproducible visualizations created with `ggplot2` to communicate statistical results effectively.

## Tools and packages

- **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2, glmmTMB, survival, brms, dplyr)
- **Statistical approaches:** mixed models, Bayesian inference, quantitative genetics
